Tarts Library Change Log - (to explain what changed and why)

V1.0  Initial Release Dec-11, 2014

V1.1  Maintenance Update Jan-23, 2015
  - Sensor Data Messages did not include any wireless device status like 
    received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or battery voltage.  To address
    this, the "SensorMessageEvent" callback parameters have been changed to address
    single class called "SensorMessage" that contains the sensorID string, RSSI,
    battery voltage, a list of datums, and the number of datums available.  
    Application Sketches or examples have been updated to use this new callback
  - In Raspberry Pi and BeagleboneBlack Platforms: The Serial Read Thread now
    sleeps 10ms between read attempts.  This is to lighten the processor load.
  - Makefiles changed to reflect the new version of library.
  - Negative temperature values would report as -9.-3C.  Tilt values as well. Bug fixed in four sensor types: Temp, Water Temp, Humidity, Tilt.
  - Demo Applications were modified: to include water rope where needed, to print out RSSI and Battery Voltage, and to sleep for 100 ms inbetween loops.
